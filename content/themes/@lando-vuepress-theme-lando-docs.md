* Easily distributable default config sets and shared navbar items
* Additional `containers` to help spruce up your Markdown
* Google Analytics/Tag Manager support
* HubSpot tracking code support
* Automatic metatag generation
* Features to help combining different docs sites into a single coherent docs experience
* `Docsearch` support
* Customizable `SidebarHeader` header for more larger and more complex sites
* Automatically generated and customizable _Previous Versions_ page
* Automatically generated and customizable _Contributorz_ page
* Additional `Guide` page type
* Additional global components for `YouTube` and `MailChimp`
* `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` generation
