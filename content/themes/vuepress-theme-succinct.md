# vuepress-theme-succinct

A slightly opinionated theme for Vuepress

## Features

- **Customizable typography**: Webfont support with font size and text-adjustment customization
- **Dark and light themes**: System theme detection with a theme-switcher to set the theme as per the user preference
- **Accessible**: Larger font size, deeper contrast, better legibility preferences to improve the readability

## Get Started

Add the dependency to your existing Vuepress project via Yarn or NPM.

```sh
yarn add -D vuepress-theme-succinct
npm install -D vuepress-theme-succinct
```

Update `.vuepress/config.js` as follows.

```js
module.exports = {
  theme: 'vuepress-theme-succinct',
  globalUIComponents: [
    'ThemeManager'
  ],
}
```

`ThemeManager` provides theme-switching functionality across the app.

Note that you can also use the shorthand name for the theme.

```js
module.exports = {
  theme: 'succinct',
  globalUIComponents: [
    'ThemeManager'
  ],
}
```
