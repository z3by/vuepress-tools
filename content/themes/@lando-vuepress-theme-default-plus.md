# VuePress 2 Default Theme+ (DEPRECATED!)

**[VitePress](https://vitepress.dev) has gained considerable traction since we first started working on this and appears to be the winner vs VuePress2. As a consequence we have switched over to VitePress and will no longer be maintaining this theme.**

**We recommend you do the same and if you are interested in similar-ish features for VitePress we have [a theme for that](https://vitepress-theme-default-plus.lando.dev/) as well.**

## Overview

This extends the [default VuePress 2 theme](https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/reference/default-theme/config.html#basic-config) with some extra power and features such as:

* Easily distributable default config sets and shared navbar items
* Additional `containers` to help spruce up your Markdown
* Google Analytics/Tag Manager support
* HubSpot tracking code support
* Automatic metatag generation
* Features to help combining different docs sites into a single coherent docs experience
* `Docsearch` support
* Customizable `SidebarHeader` header for more larger and more complex sites
* Automatically generated and customizable _Previous Versions_ page
* Automatically generated and customizable _Contributorz_ page
* Additional `Guide` page type
* Additional global components for `YouTube` and `MailChimp`
* `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` generation
* [CarbonAds](https://www.carbonads.net/) support

Note that autogeneration of contributors and versioning information currently only works with GitHub. You can, however, manually populate these values for other VCS for now.

## Releasing

To deploy and publish a new version of the package to the `npm` registry you need only [create a release on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository) with a [semver](https://semver.org) tag.

Note that prereleases will get pushed to the `edge` tag on the `npm` registry.
